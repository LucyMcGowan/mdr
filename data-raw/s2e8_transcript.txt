<html><a id="section000655958" class="timestamp" href="#section000655958">00:06:55</a></html>
Hampton: Yeah, well, with the market readjustment from a few years ago and the fluctuating interest rates, there was a retrenchment from some of the core infrastructure investments.

<html><a id="section000714059" class="timestamp" href="#section000714059">00:07:14</a></html>
Harmony: I need a favor. But not here. Meet me at the factory.

Dot: Sure.

<html><a id="section000957973" class="timestamp" href="#section000957973">00:09:57</a></html>
Hampton: You know how fucked it is to ask me to come here?

<html><a id="section001003770" class="timestamp" href="#section001003770">00:10:03</a></html>
Harmony: I need you to drive me to Sissy's.

<html><a id="section001013530" class="timestamp" href="#section001013530">00:10:13</a></html>
Hampton: No, thanks.

<html><a id="section001018577" class="timestamp" href="#section001018577">00:10:18</a></html>

<html><a id="section001025334" class="timestamp" href="#section001025334">00:10:25</a></html>
Hampton: How much trouble are you in?

<html><a id="section001031089" class="timestamp" href="#section001031089">00:10:31</a></html>
Harmony: Enough.

<html><a id="section001041975" class="timestamp" href="#section001041975">00:10:41</a></html>
Hampton: You know she still lives by the nine?

<html><a id="section001047105" class="timestamp" href="#section001047105">00:10:47</a></html>
Harmony: I assumed.

<html><a id="section001049566" class="timestamp" href="#section001049566">00:10:49</a></html>
Hampton: Then you know she's a fucking pariah here.

<html><a id="section001053904" class="timestamp" href="#section001053904">00:10:53</a></html>
Harmony: You can stay in the truck. I need to get something.

<html><a id="section001104915" class="timestamp" href="#section001104915">00:11:04</a></html>
Hampton: Why would I help you with anything?

<html><a id="section001113131" class="timestamp" href="#section001113131">00:11:13</a></html>
Harmony: We were once chums. Old colleagues lift each other up.

<html><a id="section001123809" class="timestamp" href="#section001123809">00:11:23</a></html>
Hampton: Colleagues? Child fucking labor.

<html><a id="section001137990" class="timestamp" href="#section001137990">00:11:37</a></html>
Harmony: Kier and Imogene met at the Ether Mill, you know that?

<html><a id="section001147749" class="timestamp" href="#section001147749">00:11:47</a></html>
Hampton: Was she hacking up a lung at the time?

<html><a id="section001151211" class="timestamp" href="#section001151211">00:11:51</a></html>
Harmony: I can smell it on your breath. Pathetic.

<html><a id="section001154965" class="timestamp" href="#section001154965">00:11:54</a></html>
Hampton: Fuck you.

<html><a id="section001156925" class="timestamp" href="#section001156925">00:11:56</a></html>
Harmony: You can help me or not. But I'll not be the punching dummy for your resentments.

<html><a id="section001345951" class="timestamp" href="#section001345951">00:13:45</a></html>
Hampton: Coast is clear.

<html><a id="section001356044" class="timestamp" href="#section001356044">00:13:56</a></html>
Harmony: You're higher than a bearded vulture.

<html><a id="section001405053" class="timestamp" href="#section001405053">00:14:05</a></html>
Hampton: Tell her to drop dead for me.

<html><a id="section001418233" class="timestamp" href="#section001418233">00:14:18</a></html>
Sissy: You are not welcome here. This is trespass. I have a mind to call the authorities. I do not want that huff peddler on my property.

<html><a id="section001435709" class="timestamp" href="#section001435709">00:14:35</a></html>
Harmony: You gave him his thirst for it.

<html><a id="section001438337" class="timestamp" href="#section001438337">00:14:38</a></html>
Sissy: You've a liar's mouth. Do you want to come down here and tell me what this is all about?

<html><a id="section001514957" class="timestamp" href="#section001514957">00:15:14</a></html>
Harmony: What have you done with my things?

<html><a id="section001518794" class="timestamp" href="#section001518794">00:15:18</a></html>
Sissy: Sold. To the poor.

<html><a id="section001521547" class="timestamp" href="#section001521547">00:15:21</a></html>
Harmony: They weren't yours to sell.

<html><a id="section001524842" class="timestamp" href="#section001524842">00:15:24</a></html>
Sissy: I sit in this house. You do not.

<html><a id="section001529555" class="timestamp" href="#section001529555">00:15:29</a></html>
Harmony: Has anyone been here?

<html><a id="section001532850" class="timestamp" href="#section001532850">00:15:32</a></html>
Sissy: No one comes here.

<html><a id="section001536270" class="timestamp" href="#section001536270">00:15:36</a></html>
Harmony: Or telephoned?

<html><a id="section001543277" class="timestamp" href="#section001543277">00:15:43</a></html>
Sissy: A Mr. Drummond.

<html><a id="section001547322" class="timestamp" href="#section001547322">00:15:47</a></html>
Harmony: And what did he want?

<html><a id="section001554037" class="timestamp" href="#section001554037">00:15:54</a></html>
Sissy: What have you done, little mouse?

<html><a id="section001601461" class="timestamp" href="#section001601461">00:16:01</a></html>
Sissy: Harmony!

<html><a id="section001603297" class="timestamp" href="#section001603297">00:16:03</a></html>
Harmony: I want the key to Mother's room.

<html><a id="section001605090" class="timestamp" href="#section001605090">00:16:05</a></html>
Sissy: That room stays shut until all who remember her sit with Kier. You know this.

<html><a id="section001611346" class="timestamp" href="#section001611346">00:16:11</a></html>
Harmony: Give me the key.

<html><a id="section001614183" class="timestamp" href="#section001614183">00:16:14</a></html>
Sissy: Why do you bring nothing but woe into my life?

<html><a id="section001618228" class="timestamp" href="#section001618228">00:16:18</a></html>
Harmony: No, it is you who cursed this house with woe.

<html><a id="section001622983" class="timestamp" href="#section001622983">00:16:22</a></html>
Sissy: I will not have this quarrel.

<html><a id="section001628447" class="timestamp" href="#section001628447">00:16:28</a></html>
Harmony: What were her last words?

<html><a id="section001631533" class="timestamp" href="#section001631533">00:16:31</a></html>
Sissy: Child, do not test me.

<html><a id="section001635746" class="timestamp" href="#section001635746">00:16:35</a></html>
Harmony: What were they? She said nothing after you pulled the tube from her gullet.

<html><a id="section001701396" class="timestamp" href="#section001701396">00:17:01</a></html>
Sissy: There was gratitude in her eyes to be freed from her suffering. If only she had been a believer. Perhaps she would have found solace in the nine.

<html><a id="section001733011" class="timestamp" href="#section001733011">00:17:33</a></html>
Sissy: You didn't have to listen to her wheezing as I did, day after day.

<html><a id="section001744523" class="timestamp" href="#section001744523">00:17:44</a></html>
Harmony: I would have cared for her myself, had I not been at school.

<html><a id="section001751655" class="timestamp" href="#section001751655">00:17:51</a></html>
Sissy: Where you belonged.

<html><a id="section001757452" class="timestamp" href="#section001757452">00:17:57</a></html>
Harmony: I didn't even get to say goodbye.

<html><a id="section001802124" class="timestamp" href="#section001802124">00:18:02</a></html>
Sissy: Your studies were more important. Mr. Eagan saw Kier in you. He really did. And the Wintertide Fellowship. Even at the factory, no apprentice was more industrious than you. Such a disappointment you've proven to be.

<html><a id="section001833822" class="timestamp" href="#section001833822">00:18:33</a></html>
Harmony: What did Drummond tell you?

<html><a id="section001839036" class="timestamp" href="#section001839036">00:18:39</a></html>
Sissy: Return and plead forgiveness, child. The Eagans will grant it.

<html><a id="section001847377" class="timestamp" href="#section001847377">00:18:47</a></html>
Harmony: And show me mercy, just like you did with Mother.

<html><a id="section001900432" class="timestamp" href="#section001900432">00:19:00</a></html>
Harmony: Where is the key?

<html><a id="section001915489" class="timestamp" href="#section001915489">00:19:15</a></html>
Sissy: All you will find in there is pain.

<html><a id="section001952609" class="timestamp" href="#section001952609">00:19:52</a></html>
Harmony: Where is it?

<html><a id="section002011545" class="timestamp" href="#section002011545">00:20:11</a></html>
Harmony: I found it!

<html><a id="section002022097" class="timestamp" href="#section002022097">00:20:22</a></html>
Harmony: Come on.

<html><a id="section002406655" class="timestamp" href="#section002406655">00:24:06</a></html>
Sissy: Don't! Stand away!

<html><a id="section002407781" class="timestamp" href="#section002407781">00:24:07</a></html>
Hampton: Get your harpy hands off me.

<html><a id="section002409366" class="timestamp" href="#section002409366">00:24:09</a></html>
Sissy: You've no salutation here, you blighted snuff slave.

<html><a id="section002413203" class="timestamp" href="#section002413203">00:24:13</a></html>
Hampton: All right, I missed you too. You smell like crow skin.

<html><a id="section002415247" class="timestamp" href="#section002415247">00:24:15</a></html>
Sissy: I'll phone somebody. I swear it!

<html><a id="section002416915" class="timestamp" href="#section002416915">00:24:16</a></html>
Hampton: Yeah, call everyone. We'll have a fucking kegger.

<html><a id="section002419543" class="timestamp" href="#section002419543">00:24:19</a></html>
Sissy: This is a pure house.

<html><a id="section002420794" class="timestamp" href="#section002420794">00:24:20</a></html>
Hampton: Back off or I'll put you in the bay!

<html><a id="section002428719" class="timestamp" href="#section002428719">00:24:28</a></html>
Harmony: What is it? What happened?

<html><a id="section002430262" class="timestamp" href="#section002430262">00:24:30</a></html>
Hampton: Nothing. Came to get you. She's not too happy about it.

<html><a id="section002435309" class="timestamp" href="#section002435309">00:24:35</a></html>
Harmony: Did you see something?

<html><a id="section002436977" class="timestamp" href="#section002436977">00:24:36</a></html>
Hampton: No, but it's cold as shit in the truck, and I gotta get back.

<html><a id="section002442191" class="timestamp" href="#section002442191">00:24:42</a></html>
Harmony: I have to find it.

<html><a id="section002444610" class="timestamp" href="#section002444610">00:24:44</a></html>
Hampton: Find what?

<html><a id="section002447487" class="timestamp" href="#section002447487">00:24:47</a></html>
Harmony: Just give me a minute just to think.

<html><a id="section002510802" class="timestamp" href="#section002510802">00:25:10</a></html>
Hampton: I liked her.

<html><a id="section002520729" class="timestamp" href="#section002520729">00:25:20</a></html>
Harmony: You barely knew her.

<html><a id="section002525025" class="timestamp" href="#section002525025">00:25:25</a></html>
Hampton: She hated Lumon more than I did. That's all I needed to know. At least she doesn't have to live with Sissy anymore.

<html><a id="section002608360" class="timestamp" href="#section002608360">00:26:08</a></html>
Hampton: You wanna get high?

<html><a id="section002726772" class="timestamp" href="#section002726772">00:27:26</a></html>
Harmony: Wow. Oh, I haven't done that since I was eight.

<html><a id="section002741828" class="timestamp" href="#section002741828">00:27:41</a></html>
Hampton: You ready to man the vat for ten hours?

<html><a id="section002755175" class="timestamp" href="#section002755175">00:27:55</a></html>
Harmony: It's so shameful that you sell it.

<html><a id="section002840512" class="timestamp" href="#section002840512">00:28:40</a></html>
Hampton: I don't think it's here. What you're looking for.

<html><a id="section002855110" class="timestamp" href="#section002855110">00:28:55</a></html>
Sissy: Get out of here!

<html><a id="section002902743" class="timestamp" href="#section002902743">00:29:02</a></html>
Harmony: She wouldn't throw it away.

<html><a id="section003113373" class="timestamp" href="#section003113373">00:31:13</a></html>
Hampton: Find it?

<html><a id="section003115709" class="timestamp" href="#section003115709">00:31:15</a></html>
Harmony: Get the truck ready. And watch my head.

<html><a id="section003128805" class="timestamp" href="#section003128805">00:31:28</a></html>
Harmony: I'm going. Don't tell them I was here.

<html><a id="section003131725" class="timestamp" href="#section003131725">00:31:31</a></html>
Sissy: I would never bear falsity to a steward of the Eagans.

<html><a id="section003137606" class="timestamp" href="#section003137606">00:31:37</a></html>
Harmony: Lumon destroyed this town. You owe them no loyalty.

<html><a id="section003144988" class="timestamp" href="#section003144988">00:31:44</a></html>
Sissy: There was no town before the factory. And what about your own employ? Everything that you have, you owe back to the Eagans as fealty.

<html><a id="section003200254" class="timestamp" href="#section003200254">00:32:00</a></html>
Harmony: Fealty? Mine! My designs! Circuit blueprint... Base code... Overtime contingency... Glasgow block. All of it.

<html><a id="section003222818" class="timestamp" href="#section003222818">00:32:22</a></html>
Sissy: Jame Eagan was the inventor.

<html><a id="section003225779" class="timestamp" href="#section003225779">00:32:25</a></html>
Harmony: So I've heard.

<html><a id="section003244298" class="timestamp" href="#section003244298">00:32:44</a></html>
Sissy: Extraordinary. Why have you never spoken of this?

<html><a id="section003252389" class="timestamp" href="#section003252389">00:32:52</a></html>
Harmony: It was told Kier's knowledge is for all.

<html><a id="section003257686" class="timestamp" href="#section003257686">00:32:57</a></html>
Sissy: That is true.

<html><a id="section003300898" class="timestamp" href="#section003300898">00:33:00</a></html>
Harmony: That if I sought credit, I would be banished.

<html><a id="section003320501" class="timestamp" href="#section003320501">00:33:20</a></html>
Harmony: I hope you die as painfully as she did.

<html><a id="section003326256" class="timestamp" href="#section003326256">00:33:26</a></html>
Sissy: It was her hand that removed the tube, not mine.

<html><a id="section003330385" class="timestamp" href="#section003330385">00:33:30</a></html>
Harmony: No!

<html><a id="section003332679" class="timestamp" href="#section003332679">00:33:32</a></html>
Sissy: Your mother was a coward. More sick in the soul than in the body. Filled with malice and resentment.

<html><a id="section003346944" class="timestamp" href="#section003346944">00:33:46</a></html>
Harmony: I don't believe you!

<html><a id="section003350572" class="timestamp" href="#section003350572">00:33:50</a></html>
Sissy: I thought you were different... my flower. I tried to help you grow. But now I see you are a weed, just as she was.

<html><a id="section003409507" class="timestamp" href="#section003409507">00:34:09</a></html>
Hampton: Hey! Someone's comin'!

<html><a id="section003426775" class="timestamp" href="#section003426775">00:34:26</a></html>
Hampton: You better get going.
