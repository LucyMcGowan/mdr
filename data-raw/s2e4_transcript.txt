<html><a id="section000112573" class="timestamp" href="#section000112573">00:01:12</a></html>

<html><a id="section000233695" class="timestamp" href="#section000233695">00:02:33</a></html>

Mark: Hey!

<html><a id="section000258262" class="timestamp" href="#section000258262">00:02:58</a></html>
Mark: Are you okay?

<html><a id="section000300222" class="timestamp" href="#section000300222">00:03:00</a></html>
Irving: Did you wake up on the ice too?

<html><a id="section000300223" class="timestamp" href="#section000300223">00:03:00</a></html>
Mark: Yeah. What about you?

<html><a id="section000301890" class="timestamp" href="#section000301890">00:03:01</a></html>
Helly: On the cliff.

<html><a id="section000305060" class="timestamp" href="#section000305060">00:03:05</a></html>
Irving: Oh, my God.

<html><a id="section000309147" class="timestamp" href="#section000309147">00:03:09</a></html>
Dylan: Is it you?

<html><a id="section000309147" class="timestamp" href="#section000309147">00:03:09</a></html>
Helly: Of course it's us.

<html><a id="section000311358" class="timestamp" href="#section000311358">00:03:11</a></html>
Dylan: Holy shit! Out-fucking-side. Oh, my God. I mean, I knew there was no actual ceiling, but this is fucking insane.

<html><a id="section000322661" class="timestamp" href="#section000322661">00:03:22</a></html>
Helly: Hello? Hello?

<html><a id="section000335757" class="timestamp" href="#section000335757">00:03:35</a></html>
Mark: What is that?

<html><a id="section000430604" class="timestamp" href="#section000430604">00:04:30</a></html>
Milchick: Good morning, Refiners.

<html><a id="section000433232" class="timestamp" href="#section000433232">00:04:33</a></html>
Milchick: This is Mr. Milchick from work, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to your first ever outdoor retreat and team-building occurrence.

<html><a id="section000444243" class="timestamp" href="#section000444243">00:04:44</a></html>
Milchick: This ORTBO is in response to your desire to see the outside world. With your outies' blessings, you will spend the next two calendar days walking the meadows, thickets, brambles and brooks that make up the Dieter Eagan National Forest.

<html><a id="section000503303" class="timestamp" href="#section000503303">00:05:03</a></html>
Dylan: Who the fuck is Dieter Eagan?

<html><a id="section000507933" class="timestamp" href="#section000507933">00:05:07</a></html>
Milchick: Dieter Eagan? Some of you may be quietly yearning to learn more. The truth you seek lies within the fourth appendix. Kier dictated a fourth appendix in his final hours of life, a text of such sanctity that it is forbidden upon the severed floor. It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave, the very same grotto where Kier Eagan tamed the four tempers for the very first time.

<html><a id="section000539965" class="timestamp" href="#section000539965">00:05:39</a></html>
Milchick: And do remember, "Stray not from Kier's path, lest you roil nature's wrath." There will be help along the way. Happy fortunes, MDR.

<html><a id="section000604990" class="timestamp" href="#section000604990">00:06:04</a></html>
Irving: Scissor Cave.

<html><a id="section000617127" class="timestamp" href="#section000617127">00:06:17</a></html>
Dylan: What the fuck is that?

<html><a id="section000628847" class="timestamp" href="#section000628847">00:06:28</a></html>
Helly: He looks like Mark.

<html><a id="section000642903" class="timestamp" href="#section000642903">00:06:42</a></html>
Mark: Milchick said there'd be help along the way.

<html><a id="section000646865" class="timestamp" href="#section000646865">00:06:46</a></html>
Irving : I wouldn't trust a word out of that mountebank's mouth. Not even televisually.

<html><a id="section000705634" class="timestamp" href="#section000705634">00:07:05</a></html>
Mark: Not like we have a lot of other options right now, Irv.

<html><a id="section000948297" class="timestamp" href="#section000948297">00:09:48</a></html>
Helly: Wait.

<html><a id="section001033008" class="timestamp" href="#section001033008">00:10:33</a></html>
Helly: "Chapter one."

<html><a id="section001036678" class="timestamp" href="#section001036678">00:10:36</a></html>
Helly: "I was not born into this world alone. The lodgings of my mother's womb I shared with another, a twin brother who was called Dieter."

<html><a id="section001047314" class="timestamp" href="#section001047314">00:10:47</a></html>
Irving: Kier had a twin?

<html><a id="section001050651" class="timestamp" href="#section001050651">00:10:50</a></html>
Dylan: That's what those things are.

<html><a id="section001053237" class="timestamp" href="#section001053237">00:10:53</a></html>
Mark: Yeah.

<html><a id="section001055572" class="timestamp" href="#section001055572">00:10:55</a></html>
Helly: "In infancy, he was my bosom friend. But as we blossomed into boyhood, he beseeched me to take to the wood with him to live as paupers. My love for my twin unbalancing my judgment, I acceded, and we ventured into the wood towards..."

<html><a id="section001114466" class="timestamp" href="#section001114466">00:11:14</a></html>
Helly and Dylan: "Woe's Hollow."

<html><a id="section001123183" class="timestamp" href="#section001123183">00:11:23</a></html>
Irving: So, we're to walk in the brothers' footsteps.

<html><a id="section001133026" class="timestamp" href="#section001133026">00:11:33</a></html>
Irving: "He always crept like this at this hour."

<html><a id="section001137823" class="timestamp" href="#section001137823">00:11:37</a></html>
Irving: "Once concealed by flora, my brother..."

<html><a id="section001141243" class="timestamp" href="#section001141243">00:11:41</a></html>
Kier: "...unfastened himself."

<html><a id="section001143662" class="timestamp" href="#section001143662">00:11:43</a></html>
Kier: "The din of his fervor fell strangely into concert with the music of the wood."

<html><a id="section001151461" class="timestamp" href="#section001151461">00:11:51</a></html>
Kier: "His every thrust found rhythm with the trill of the crickets..."

<html><a id="section001157259" class="timestamp" href="#section001157259">00:11:57</a></html>
Kier and Irving: "...and the moaning of the wind..."

<html><a id="section001200470" class="timestamp" href="#section001200470">00:12:00</a></html>
Kier and Irving: "...and the snowfall's yearly thaw."

<html><a id="section001204016" class="timestamp" href="#section001204016">00:12:04</a></html>
Kier: "Dieter became, on that night an instrument of nature..."

<html><a id="section001209313" class="timestamp" href="#section001209313">00:12:09</a></html>
Kier and Irving: "and nature played Dieter with elegance."

<html><a id="section001212983" class="timestamp" href="#section001212983">00:12:12</a></html>
Irving: "I had no choice but to listen as he spilt his lineage upon the soil."

<html><a id="section001243222" class="timestamp" href="#section001243222">00:12:43</a></html>
Dylan: Now there's a me one.

<html><a id="section001328767" class="timestamp" href="#section001328767">00:13:28</a></html>
Mark: You okay?

<html><a id="section001331103" class="timestamp" href="#section001331103">00:13:31</a></html>
Helly: Yeah. I just wish I knew where we were going.

<html><a id="section001359423" class="timestamp" href="#section001359423">00:13:59</a></html>
Dylan: Fuck.

<html><a id="section001424406" class="timestamp" href="#section001424406">00:14:24</a></html>
Irving: What were you and Helly talking about back there?

<html><a id="section001437044" class="timestamp" href="#section001437044">00:14:37</a></html>
Mark: When?

<html><a id="section001439713" class="timestamp" href="#section001439713">00:14:39</a></html>
Irving: I don't trust her. I think she might be lying about what her outie saw.

<html><a id="section001446553" class="timestamp" href="#section001446553">00:14:46</a></html>
Mark: Why would you think that?

<html><a id="section001448514" class="timestamp" href="#section001448514">00:14:48</a></html>
Irving: Night gardeners.

<html><a id="section001452059" class="timestamp" href="#section001452059">00:14:52</a></html>
Irving: It's clear you do not have an objective perspective due to your feelings for her.

<html><a id="section001456021" class="timestamp" href="#section001456021">00:14:56</a></html>
Mark: My feelings for her have nothing to do with anything, okay--

<html><a id="section001520754" class="timestamp" href="#section001520754">00:15:20</a></html>
Dylan: What the fuck?

<html><a id="section001525008" class="timestamp" href="#section001525008">00:15:25</a></html>
Irving: What is it?

<html><a id="section001527219" class="timestamp" href="#section001527219">00:15:27</a></html>
Mark: I don't know. Looks like a seal?

<html><a id="section001537062" class="timestamp" href="#section001537062">00:15:37</a></html>
Helly: Why does it look so messed up?

<html><a id="section001540774" class="timestamp" href="#section001540774">00:15:40</a></html>
Mark: I don't know. Maybe this is what dead things look like.

<html><a id="section001546280" class="timestamp" href="#section001546280">00:15:46</a></html>
Irving: We should eat it.

<html><a id="section001548282" class="timestamp" href="#section001548282">00:15:48</a></html>
Dylan: Pardon me?

<html><a id="section001549283" class="timestamp" href="#section001549283">00:15:49</a></html>
Irving: We don't know if there's food waiting at the hollow. We don't even know where we are.

<html><a id="section001554955" class="timestamp" href="#section001554955">00:15:54</a></html>
Dylan: They can't let anything happen to us. It's an ORTBO. Outdoor retreat team-building occurrence. Right, Mark?

<html><a id="section001601879" class="timestamp" href="#section001601879">00:16:01</a></html>
Irving: We don't know what this is. We don't know anything!

<html><a id="section001604591" class="timestamp" href="#section001604591">00:16:04</a></html>
Mark: Irving, calm down.

<html><a id="section001609136" class="timestamp" href="#section001609136">00:16:09</a></html>
Mark: We all know you had a bad experience the last time you were outside--

<html><a id="section001612139" class="timestamp" href="#section001612139">00:16:12</a></html>
Irving: Who said I had a bad experience?

<html><a id="section001614600" class="timestamp" href="#section001614600">00:16:14</a></html>
Mark: Oh, my God.

<html><a id="section001617895" class="timestamp" href="#section001617895">00:16:17</a></html>
Irving: What did you tell him, dumbass?

<html><a id="section001619646" class="timestamp" href="#section001619646">00:16:19</a></html>
Dylan: Nothing! What the fuck?

<html><a id="section001623775" class="timestamp" href="#section001623775">00:16:23</a></html>
Mark: Let's just get to the hollow.

<html><a id="section001719957" class="timestamp" href="#section001719957">00:17:19</a></html>
Milchick: Kier's twin was always with him. That's why we provided the very same for each of you.

<html><a id="section001728131" class="timestamp" href="#section001728131">00:17:28</a></html>
Dylan: Fuck you all. I was right.

<html><a id="section001730092" class="timestamp" href="#section001730092">00:17:30</a></html>
Irving: Mr. Milchick.

<html><a id="section001732594" class="timestamp" href="#section001732594">00:17:32</a></html>
Milchick: This is the tallest waterfall on the planet. You have followed the path of Kier and Dieter, and reached Woe's Hollow. You stand upon sacred earth.

<html><a id="section001747442" class="timestamp" href="#section001747442">00:17:47</a></html>
Irving: We're starving, Mr. Milchick.

<html><a id="section001750362" class="timestamp" href="#section001750362">00:17:50</a></html>
Milchick: Are you? I thought the waterfall's grandeur would satiate you. I'm teasing, of course. Lumon will always protect and provide. Right this way.

<html><a id="section001906480" class="timestamp" href="#section001906480">00:19:06</a></html>
Milchick: Miss Huang has been readying the grill for which we brought in copious luxury meats. The fire will be used for marshmallows and a recital later. The tents, as you can see, are MDR blue and the outhouse is stocked with four-ply washroom tissue.

<html><a id="section001928627" class="timestamp" href="#section001928627">00:19:28</a></html>
Helly: Wow.

<html><a id="section001930671" class="timestamp" href="#section001930671">00:19:30</a></html>
Milchick: Wow, indeed, Helly R.

<html><a id="section001933674" class="timestamp" href="#section001933674">00:19:33</a></html>
Milchick: Also, for your comfort and safety, torches, which can provide both a heat and a light source. Double duty.

<html><a id="section001946061" class="timestamp" href="#section001946061">00:19:46</a></html>
Mark: It's beautiful.

<html><a id="section001949857" class="timestamp" href="#section001949857">00:19:49</a></html>
Ms. Huang: Pretty cool, right?

<html><a id="section001954111" class="timestamp" href="#section001954111">00:19:54</a></html>
Irving: Yes, lovely.

<html><a id="section002002411" class="timestamp" href="#section002002411">00:20:02</a></html>
Helly: Irving?

<html><a id="section002003912" class="timestamp" href="#section002003912">00:20:03</a></html>
Irving: Enter.

<html><a id="section002018594" class="timestamp" href="#section002018594">00:20:18</a></html>
Helly: Made you a snow seal. In case you were hungry.

<html><a id="section002031607" class="timestamp" href="#section002031607">00:20:31</a></html>
Irving: Yeah. I feel silly for suggesting we eat that animal. I suppose it sounded alarmist and paranoid. Irrational.

<html><a id="section002044703" class="timestamp" href="#section002044703">00:20:44</a></html>
Helly: No. It was fine. We were all a little... Yeah.

<html><a id="section002103305" class="timestamp" href="#section002103305">00:21:03</a></html>
Irving: What did you really see during the overtime contingency?

<html><a id="section002114191" class="timestamp" href="#section002114191">00:21:14</a></html>
Helly: I told you.

<html><a id="section002117611" class="timestamp" href="#section002117611">00:21:17</a></html>
Irving: It's okay. It won't change anything.

<html><a id="section002131291" class="timestamp" href="#section002131291">00:21:31</a></html>
Helly: Irving.

<html><a id="section002143929" class="timestamp" href="#section002143929">00:21:43</a></html>
Helly: Okay.

<html><a id="section002206618" class="timestamp" href="#section002206618">00:22:06</a></html>
Milchick: "Dieter lay unwashed in his bedroll, though the hollow's pool was primed for bathing. We ate of the hare we'd caught and told each other rhyming jokes till our gullets ached. But at last, the thought tickling my mouth emerged. 'We must return to Father,' I said. 'But I promise to look after you in the ether mill.' When at last a sound came from him, it was a bewailing whimper. He believed, I suppose, that we'd be woodland paupers forever."

<html><a id="section002248911" class="timestamp" href="#section002248911">00:22:48</a></html>
Milchick: "I was looking at him when his eye came out. It popped from the socket, driven by a sudden torrent of pus from his skull. And he reached up to grasp at his hair, which was suddenly moss that tore easily from his bleeding scalp."

Milchick: "And as the pus from his eye thickened into sap, I turned from my gargling brother and walked to the pool of the hollow, where I knew the waterfall would drown out my brother's cries."

Milchick: "And it was here that I first encountered the temper Woe, a gaunt bride, half the height of a natural woman. She spoke to me directly from her eyes and said, 'This is your doing. You suffered his wantonness. Now he's no one's brother. Only chaos's whore.'"

<html><a id="section002454745" class="timestamp" href="#section002454745">00:24:54</a></html>
Milchick: The handbook enriches our work with tales of the founder's life. Every word is truth.

Helly: You guys... He melted, right? He turned into the forest because he masturbated. I mean, seriously, that's actually the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Right? He jerked off in front of his brother... and he got punished for it.

<html><a id="section002541416" class="timestamp" href="#section002541416">00:25:41</a></html>
Mark: Wha... You can't say that.

<html><a id="section002543043" class="timestamp" href="#section002543043">00:25:43</a></html>

Milchick: You know, we often laugh at what we don't understand. The team I thought I knew would have processed more thoughtfully.

Dylan: Why?

<html><a id="section002638640" class="timestamp" href="#section002638640">00:26:38</a></html>
Milchick: Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan. They don't just hand them out.

<html><a id="section002650235" class="timestamp" href="#section002650235">00:26:50</a></html>

Helly: Okay.

Mark: Yeah.

<html><a id="section002821660" class="timestamp" href="#section002821660">00:28:21</a></html>

<html><a id="section003059067" class="timestamp" href="#section003059067">00:30:59</a></html>
Mark: I mean, he kind of deserved it. And I can make goo-goo eyes at anyone I want. Are you okay?
